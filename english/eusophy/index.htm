<h1>EUSOPHY__The Supreme Intellectual Vocation</h1>
<div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This article is a reorganized and abridged translation of its <a href="../../eusophy/index.htm">Japanese counterpart</a> (JC), and it amplifies the non-mathematical part of my paper <a href="AMG.pdf">Foundations of Eusophy: A mathematical concept of God for the reconciliation of religion and science</a>—hereafter referred to as MP (mother paper).
It, in turn, was born of my earlier paper <a href="../noology/index.htm">Mathematical Noology: Intellectual machines, logic, tongues and algebra</a>—hereafter referred to as FP (fore-paper).
</p>
<p>
Anyone should know the non-mathematical part of MP—or at least the spirit of the new intellectual deed proposed and called <span id="EUSOPHY">eusophy</span> there—because it is crucial both for humankind and for individuals.
Namely, it leads to an answer to the problem:
</p>
<blockquote>
What should anyone do?
</blockquote>
<p>
and it aims at:
</p>
<blockquote>
the pursuit of a way for humankind to survive
</blockquote>
<p>
in view of the alarm climate scientists are ringing, which especially implies:
</p>
<blockquote>
In the not too distant future, the global temperature rise (the so-called global warming) may become a threat to survival of humankind.
</blockquote>
<p>
I have decided to write this article in order to introduce eusophy to worldwide general readership.
</p>
<p>
It is worth noting here that language reflects the mind—but the mind is also shaped by language.
When the words we use are misleading, our thoughts and actions may be misled as well.
For instance, the term “global warming” may unconsciously evoke the idea of a pleasantly mild climate, leading some to underestimate the severity of the crisis and to neglect necessary action.
Hence my choice to write “the global temperature rise” above.
</p>
<p>
Eusophy subsumes various intellectual deeds, because its aim—the pursuit of a way for humankind to survive—is supreme, as suggested by the title of this article.
It also transcends various boundaries, both visible and invisible, such as national borders, because the alarm climate scientists are ringing is supplemented as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="ALARTPLUS">
The threat posed by rising global temperatures recognizes no boundaries, not even national ones.
</blockquote>
<p>
Both “survival” in the alarm and “survive” in the aim of eusophy imply “continuation as a species.”
Therefore, the following taxonomical knowledge is the starting point of eusophy:
</p>
<blockquote id="ORIGIN">
Humankind is but one among many species.
</blockquote>
<p>
This insight—which I call “The Declaration of Humankind's Origin”—will be emphasized together with evolutionism and climate science wherever appropriate, for the following three reasons:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Even in answering problems about humans, it is helpful to consider their nature as a kind of organisms—i.e., animals, plants, and bacteria.</li>
<li>The law of organic evolution governs how species survive.</li>
<li>The mainstay of society does not yet quite seem to react to the alarm climate scientists are ringing.</li>
</ol>
<p>
We conclude this introduction with a self-explanatory and itemized sequence of hypotheses, observations, and conclusions—most of which will be fully discussed in this article.
</p>
<h3>Hypotheses</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Hypothesis 1.</dt>
<dd>Primitive humans initiated a foundational intellectual activity, whose purpose was to understand causality in order to survive as organisms.</dd>
<dt>Hypothesis 2.</dt>
<dd>Humankind survived as a species thanks to the activity.</dd>
<dt>Hypothesis 3.</dt>
<dd>The activity gradually changed and ramified into some branches.</dd>
<dt>Hypothesis 4.</dt>
<dd>Over time, four of these branches evolved into what we now recognize as science, logic, ethics, and religion.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Observation 1 about today's science which supports Hypothesis 4.</dt>
<dd>Scientists each pursue laws which rule aspects of causality.</dd>
<dt>Observation 2 about today's logic which supports Hypothesis 4.</dt>
<dd>Logic is the knowledge of causality in terms of validity among the declaratives.</dd>
<dt>Observation 3 about today's ethics which supports Hypothesis 4.</dt>
<dd>Ethics is the teachings of deeds which are supposed to be united to moral good by causality.</dd>
<dd>It depends on how moral good is defined.</dd>
<dt>Observation 4 about today's religion which supports Hypothesis 4.</dt>
<dd>Religion is essentially a system of speculations and prayers, both on causality, and the
acceptance of their outcomes.</dd>
<dt>Observation 5 about the global temperature rise.</dt>
<dd>The global temperature rise may become a threat to survival of humankind in the not too distant future, as the alarm climate scientists are ringing especially implies.</dd>
<dt>Observation 6 about organisms.</dt>
<dd>Organisms are the systems for continuing life, which is the process of reproducing its parts, including itself.</dd>
<dt>Observation 7 about humankind.</dt>
<dd>Humankind is but one among many species by “The Declaration of Humankind's Origin.”</dd>
<dd>Humankind is distinguished from other species by its high intelligence.</dd>
<dd>Civilization, defined as the totality of human knowledges, is a representation of human intelligence.</dd>
<dt>Observation 8 about survival of humankind.</dt>
<dd>Continuation of the biosphere is necessary for survival of humankind, because humankind is a member of the biosphere and all its members are connected by the food cycle (the composite of the food chain and the carbon cycle), the symbiotic relationship, and the habitat bioprovision (the phenomenon in which part or all of an organism’s habitat is created and provided by other organisms).</dd>
<dd>Survival (continuation of life) of enough number of individuals as organisms is necessary for survival (continuation as species) of humankind.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Conclusions through Logical and Eusophic Inquiry</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Conclusion 1 about eusophy.</dt>
<dd>Today's science, logic, ethics and religion should and can unite again into eusophy, i.e. the pursuit of a way for humankind to survive.</dd>
<dt>Conclusion 2 about ethics in eusophy.</dt>
<dd>In eusophy, moral good is defined as that which contributes to survival of humankind.</dd>
<dt>Conclusion 3 about survival of humankind in eusophy.</dt>
<dd>Survival of humankind implies survival of its civilization as defined in Observation 7.</dd>
<dd>Survival of humankind depends on continuation of the biosphere.</dd>
<dd>Survival of humankind requires security, which equally guarantees survival of valuable human groups such as nations, races, ethnic groups, families, and individuals.</dd>
<dt>Conclusion 4 about what anyone should do and what one can do.</dt>
<dd>What we should do is to contribute to survival of humankind.</dd>
<dd>One can contribute to survival of humankind by contributing to survival, continuation, and security as touched in Conclusion 3 and by participating in establishing, spreading, and practicing eusophy.</dd>
<dd>One can also contribute to survival of humankind by nurturing families and communities, including one's own.</dd>

<h2>&sect;1. Intellect, Universe, and God</h2>
<p>
Although I do not adhere to any established religion, I sometimes find myself drawn to religious spaces. At a Christmas Eve service in 2012, I encountered a verse from the Gospel of John that reads:
</p>
<blockquote>
All things were made by the Word.
</blockquote>
<p>
This verse astonished me—for reasons I explain below.
</p>
<p>
Since 1992, I have been studying intellect, which I define as the ability to know the objective world. This inquiry was motivated by the question, “What is humanity?” and guided by the proposition:
</p>
<blockquote>
Humankind is a species distinguished from other species by its intellect.
</blockquote>
<p>
Intellect is inseparably linked to language, in the following sense:
</p>
<blockquote>
Intellect evolved because humankind acquired language.
</blockquote>
<p>
This evolutionary process may be outlined as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>In early human societies, intellect existed prior to language.</li>
<li>Language first emerged as a tool for communication with others.</li>
<li>It then became a tool for internal communication.</li>
<li>Consequently, it developed into a medium for thought and memory.</li>
<li>By transmitting knowledge and mode of thought to future generations, it has served as a genetic analogue for the evolution of intellect.</li>
<li>Thus, intellect evolved.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This entire process may be encapsulated in the phrase: “All things were made by the Word.”
Therefore, I was astonished—because it seemed to me that John had already known everything I had just described.
</p>
<p>
The preaching, however, was disappointing.
According to it, “Word” in the Gospel of John does not mean language, but means God's words such as “Let there be light” for  creating the heaven and the earth.
With some hope, however, I turned to the World Wide Web, found that the Wisdom of Solomon has something to do with “Word,” and found out the following two verses in it:
</p>
<blockquote>
As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tell you, and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her out from the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into light, and will not pass over the truth.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
God hath granted me to speak as I would, and to conceive as is meet for the things that are given me: because it is he that leadeth unto wisdom, and directeth the wise.
</blockquote>
<p>
These verses seemed mostly adequate to a prologue and an epilogue respectively of a certain section of FP, which amplifies the above proposition “Intellect evolved because humankind acquired language.”
The latter, however, also seemed inadequate to FP, because I had long been felt that God was incompatible with science, while noology in FP is the science of intellectual phenomena.
</p>
<p>
The above inadequacy, however, was the beginning of a fortunate chain of unexpected events.
Namely, it spotlighted the problem “What is God?” in my mind.
They say that God is the ruler of the universe.
Then “What is the universe?” and “What is the rule of the universe?”
Thus, it switched on spotlight lamps in my mind one after another.
Moreover, it soon flashed in my mind that we could neatly solve the problems by using logics (general logic and case logic) in FP.
Furthermore, the answer to the problem “What is God?” showed that God is compatible with science.
It in particular showed that God subsumes the law of organic evolutionism, and therefore showed that the verse is certainly adequate to an epilogue of the section.
</p>
<p>
The prologue of the introductory chapter of FP is the proverb “Know thyself” in ancient Greece, because it seems as proposing the problem “What is humanity?” which motivates noology in FP.
The proverb is sometimes supplemented as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
Know thyself, and thou shalt know the universe and God.
</blockquote>
<p>
This seems as predicting “Noology will lead to an understanding of the universe and God.”
In any case, the prediction has come true in the first draft of MP.
Some readers have sent me useful comments on it.
Among them are the following two from a physicist and a mathematician:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Physicists have long been studying causality.</li>
<li>This paper seems good for reconciling religion and science.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The former led me to Hypothesis 1, which together with the latter led me to Conclusion 1.
Thus, MP has been completed.
