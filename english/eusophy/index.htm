<h1 id="TITLE">EUSOPHY__The Supreme Intellectual Vocation</h1>
<div>
<p>
This article is a reorganized and abridged translation of its <a href="../../eusophy/index.htm">Japanese counterpart</a> (JC), and it amplifies the non-mathematical part of my paper <a href="AMG.pdf">Foundations of Eusophy: A mathematical concept of God for the reconciliation of religion and science</a>—hereafter referred to as MP (mother paper).
It, in turn, was born of my earlier paper <a href="../noology/index.htm">Mathematical Noology: Intellectual machines, logic, tongues and algebra</a>—hereafter referred to as FP (fore-paper).
</p>
<p>
Anyone should know the non-mathematical part of MP—or at least the spirit of the new intellectual deed proposed and called <span id="EUSOPHY">eusophy</span> there—because it is crucial both for humankind and for individuals.
Namely, it leads to an answer to the question
</p>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="width:100%;">
<tr><td style="width:10%;">(1)<td id="WHATTODO">What should anyone do?</td><td style="width:10%;"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
and it aims at
</p>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="width:100%;">
<tr><td style="width:10%;">(2)<td id="AIM">The pursuit of a way for humankind to <span>survive</td><td style="width:10%;"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
in view of the following alarm based on climate science.

</p>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="width:100%;">
<tr><td style="width:10%;">(3)</td><td id="ALARM">The <span>global temperature rise</span> may become a threat to <span>survival</span> of humankind in the not too distant future, if our action against it is not enough.</td><td style="width:10%;"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Thus, I have decided to write this article in order to introduce eusophy to worldwide general readership.
</p>
<p>
It is worth noting here that language reflects the mind—but the mind is also shaped by language.
When the words we use are misleading, our thoughts and actions may be misled as well.
For instance, the widespread term <em>global warming</em> may unconsciously evoke the idea of a pleasantly mild climate, leading some to underestimate the severity of the crisis and to neglect necessary action.
Hence my choice to write <em>global temperature rise</em> above.
</p>
<p>
Eusophy subsumes various intellectual deeds, because survival of humankind depends on the state of the whole world in a long period.
It also transcends various boundaries, both visible and invisible, such as national borders, because <a href="#ALARM">the alarm (3)</a> is supplemented as follows:
</p>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="width:100%;">
<tr><td style="width:10%;">(4)</td><td id="ALARMPLUS">The threat posed by rising global temperatures recognizes no boundaries, not even national ones.</td><td style="width:10%;"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Both <em>survival</em> in <a href="#ALARM">(3)</a> and <em>survive</em> in <a href="#AIM">(2)</a> imply <em>continuation as a species</em>.
Therefore, the following taxonomical knowledge is the starting point of eusophy:
</p>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="width:100%;">
<tr><td style="width:10%;">(5)</td><td id="ORIGIN">Humankind is but one among many species.</td><td style="width:10%;"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This insight—which I call <em>The Declaration of Humankind's Origin</em>—will be emphasized together with evolutionism and climate science wherever appropriate, for the following three reasons:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Even in solving problems about humans, it is helpful to consider their nature as a kind of organisms (animals, plants, and bacteria).</li>
<li>The law of organic evolution governs how species survive.</li>
<li>The mainstay of society does not yet quite seem to react to <a href="#ALARM">the alarm (3)</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
What follows is a self-explanatory and itemized sequence of hypotheses, observations, and conclusions, all of which have fully been discussed in <a href="../../eusophy/index.htm">JC</a> of 236 A4 PDF pages.
</p>
<h3>Hypotheses</h3>
<dl>
<dt id="H1">Hypothesis 1.</dt>
<dd>Primitive humans initiated a foundational intellectual activity, whose purpose was to understand causality in order to survive as organisms.</dd>
<dt id="H2">Hypothesis 2.</dt>
<dd>Humankind survived as a species thanks to the activity.</dd>
<dt id="H3">Hypothesis 3.</dt>
<dd>The activity gradually changed and ramified into some branches.</dd>
<dt id="H4">Hypothesis 4.</dt>
<dd>Over time, four major branches evolved into what we now recognize as science, logic, ethics, and religion.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<dl>
<dt id="O1">Observation 1 about today's science which supports Hypothesis 4.</dt>
<dd>Scientists each pursue laws which rule aspects of causality.</dd>
<dt id="O2">Observation 2 about today's logic which supports Hypothesis 4.</dt>
<dd>Logic is the knowledge of causality in terms of validity among the declaratives.</dd>
<dt id="O3">Observation 3 about today's ethics which supports Hypothesis 4.</dt>
<dd>Ethics is the teachings of deeds which are supposed to be united to 
moral good by causality.</dd>
<dd>It depends on how moral good is defined.</dd>
<dt id="O4">Observation 4 about today's religion which supports Hypothesis 4.</dt>
<dd>Religion is essentially a system of speculations and prayers, both on causality, and the
acceptance of their outcomes.</dd>
<dt id="O5">Observation 5 about organisms.</dt>
<dd>Organisms are the systems for continuing life, which is the process of reproducing its parts, including itself.</dd>
<dt id="O6">Observation 6 about humankind.</dt>
<dd>Although but one among many species by <a href="#ORIGIN">(5)</a>, humankind is distinguished from other species by its high intelligence.</dd>
<dd>Civilization, defined as the totality of human knowledges, is a representation of human intelligence.</dd>
<dt id="O7">Observation 7 about survival of humankind.</dt>
<dd>Continuation of the biosphere is necessary for survival of humankind, because humankind is a member of the biosphere by <a href="#ORIGIN">(5)</a> and all its members are connected by the food cycle (the composite of the food chain and the carbon cycle), the symbiotic relationship, and the habitat bioprovision (the phenomenon in which part or all of an organism’s habitat is created and provided by other organisms).</dd>
<dd>Survival (continuation of life) of enough number of individuals as organisms is necessary for survival (continuation as species) of humankind.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Conclusions through Logical and Eusophic Inquiry</h3>
<dl>
<dt id="C1">Conclusion 1 about eusophy.</dt>
<dd>Today's science, logic, ethics and religion, or rather the essence of religion shown in <a href="#O4">Observation 4</a> should and can unite again into eusophy.</dd>
<dt>Conclusion 2 about ethics in eusophy.</dt>
<dd>In eusophy, moral good is defined as that which contributes to survival of humankind.
Indeed, it is the supreme good, because survival of humankind is supreme for humankind.</dd>
<dt>Conclusion 3 about survival of humankind in eusophy.</dt>
<dd>Survival of humankind implies survival of its civilization as defined in <a href="#O6">Observation 6</a>.</dd>
<dd><a href="#O7">Observation 7</a> shows that survival of humankind depends on continuation of the biosphere.</dd>
<dd>Survival of humankind requires security, which equally guarantees survival of valuable human groups such as nations, races, ethnic groups, families, and individuals.</dd>
<dt>Conclusion 4 about <a href="#WHATTODO">the question (1)</a>.</dt>
<dd>What we should do is to contribute to survival of humankind.</dd>
<dd>One can contribute to survival of humankind by contributing to survival, continuation, and security as touched in Conclusion 3 and by participating in establishing, spreading, and practicing eusophy.</dd>
<dd>One can also contribute to survival of humankind by nurturing families and communities, including one's own.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Although I do not adhere to any established religion, I sometimes find myself drawn to religious spaces. At a Christmas Eve service in 2012, I encountered a verse from the <em>Gospel of John</em> that reads:
</p>
<blockquote id="WORD">
All things were made by the Word.
</blockquote>
<p>
This verse astonished me—for reasons I explain below.
</p>
<p>
Since 1992, I have been studying intellect, which I define as the ability to know the objective world.
This inquiry was motivated by the question, <em>What is humanity?</em> and guided by the following proposition:
</p>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="width:100%;">
<tr><td style="width:10%;">(6)</td><td id="HUMAN">Humankind is a species distinguished from other species by its intellect.</td><td style="width:10%;"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Intellect is inseparably linked to language, in the following sense:
</p>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="width:100%;">
<tr><td style="width:10%;">(7)</td><td id="LANGUAGE">Intellect evolved because humankind acquired language.</td><td style="width:10%;"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This evolutionary process may be outlined as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>In early human societies, intellect existed prior to language.</li>
<li>Language first emerged as a tool for communication with others.</li>
<li>It then became a tool for internal communication.</li>
<li>Consequently, it developed into a medium for thought and memory.</li>
<li>By transmitting knowledge and mode of thought to future generations, it has served as a genetic analogue for the evolution of intellect.</li>
<li>Thus, intellect evolved.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This entire process may be encapsulated in <a href="#WORD">the above phrase</a> <em>All things were made by the Word</em>.
Therefore, I was astonished—because it seemed to me that John had already known everything I had just described.
</p>
<p>
The preaching, however, was disappointing.
According to it, <em>Word</em> in the <em>Gospel of John</em> does not mean language, but means God's words such as <em>Let there be light</em> for creating the heaven and the earth.
With some hope, however, I turned to the World Wide Web, found that the <em>Wisdom of Solomon</em> has something to do with <em>Word</em>, and found out the following two verses in it:
</p>
<blockquote>
As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tell you, and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her out from the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into light, and will not pass over the truth.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
God hath granted me to speak as I would, and to conceive as is meet for the things that are given me: because it is he that leadeth unto wisdom, and directeth the wise.
</blockquote>
<p>
These verses seemed mostly adequate to a prologue and an epilogue respectively of a certain section of FP, which amplifies <a href="#LANGUAGE">(7)</a>.
The latter, however, also seemed inadequate to FP, because I had long felt that God was incompatible with science, while noology in FP is the science of intellectual phenomena.
</p>
<p>
The above inadequacy, however, was the beginning of a fortunate chain of unexpected events.
Namely, it spotlighted the following in my mind:
</p>
<blockquote id="Q1">
Question 1: What is God?
</blockquote>
<p>
and since they say that God is the ruler of the universe, it switched on spotlight lamps in my mind one after another:
</p>
<blockquote id="Q23">
<p>Question 2: What is the universe?</p>
<p>Question 3: What is the rule of the universe?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Moreover, it soon flashed in my mind that we could neatly answer the questions by using logics (general logic and case logic) in FP.
</p>
<blockquote id="A2">
Answer to Question 2:
I have defined intellect as the ability to know the objective world.
Therefore, the objective world is the totality of the intellectual objects.
The intellectual objects are divided into entities and events.
An intellectual object is called an entity if we can ask whether it exists or not.
An intellectual object is called an event if we can ask whether it occurs or not.
The objective world is vast.
One works one's intellection only on some limited range of intellectual objects according to one's interest.
The objective world consists of such limited ranges.
Because of <a href="#LANGUAGE">(7)</a>, we can observe such ranges through languages.
Being a mathematical scientist, I could furthermore construct mathematical models of such ranges, on the basis of the observations.
The models constitute my answer to Question 2.
In terms of the models, the limited ranges are called the universes.
Therefore, the objective world is a multiverse consisting of the universes.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="A13">
Answer to Questions 1 and 3:
Being a mathematician, I could analyze the mathematical models obtained by the <a href="#A2">Answer to Question 2</a>, and could show in particular that the following holds for each universe:
<ol>
<li>The universe has its own causality among its events.</li>
<li id="COLLECTION">The causality is ruled by a collection of laws.
If a collection of laws rules the causality, then so does the collection obtained by adding correct rules to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Therefore, we are naturally led to the following definitions:
</p>
<ol start=3>
<li>God of the universe is the collection of laws together ruling its causality.</li>
<li>God's omnipotence is the rule over the causality.</li>
<li>God's omniscience is the capability of explaining causality by the laws ruling it.</li>
<li>God's omnipresence is the property of the causality that it applies to all events in the whole space-time.</li>
<li>God's will is the causality.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Because of <a href="#COLLECTION">the conclusion (2)</a>, we may assume that God subsumes all correct laws, such as the logical ones, the law of universal gravitation, and the law of organic evolution.
Evolutionism asserts that
</p>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="width:100%;">
<tr><td style="width:10%;">(8)</td><td id="EVOLUTIONISM">The law of organic evolution created all species.</td><td style="width:10%;"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Therefore, we may also assert that
</p>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="width:100%;">
<tr><td style="width:10%;">(9)</td><td id="CREATIONISM">God created all species.</td><td style="width:10%;"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In other words, (8) is a refinement of (9).
There are universes in which no human exists, such as physical one and mathematical one, i.e. the ranges of intellectual objects that interest physicists and mathematicians.
For other universes in which humans exist, we can define as follows:
</p>
<ol start=8>
<li>God's omnibenevolence is the property of God's will, i,e. causality, or rather the underlying law of organic evolution, that humankind was born and has survived so far under it.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This definition allows us to forget about the Problem of Evil, because the law of organic evolution is not necessarily benevolent to individuals.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, the prologue of the introductory chapter of FP is the proverb <em>Know thyself</em> in ancient Greece, because it seems as proposing the question <em>What is humanity?</em> which motivates noology in FP.
The proverb is sometimes supplemented as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
Know thyself, and thou shalt know the universe and God.
</blockquote>
<p>
This seems as predicting <em>Noology will lead to an understanding of the universe and God</em>.
In any case, the prediction has come true in the first draft of MP.
Some readers have sent me useful comments on it.
Among them are the following two from a physicist and a mathematician:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Physicists have long been studying causality.</li>
<li>This paper seems good for reconciling religion and science.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The former led me to <a href="#H1">Hypothesis 1</a>, which together with the latter led me to <a href="#C1">Conclusion 1</a>.
Thus, MP has been completed.
