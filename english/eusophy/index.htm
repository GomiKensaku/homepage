<h1>EUSOPHY__The Supreme Intellectual Vocation</h1>
<div>
<p>
This article shows the gist of its <a href="../../eusophy/index.htm">Japanese counterpart</a> (JC) and amplifies the non-mathematical part of my paper <a href="AMG.pdf">Foundations of Eusophy: A mathematical concept of God for the reconciliation of religion and science</a>, hereafter referred to as MP (mother paper).
MP is born of my paper <a href="../noology/index.htm">Mathematical Noology: Intellectual machines, logic, tongues and algebra</a>.
It is an important material for JC, although only touched here.
</p>
<p>
Anyone should know the non-mathematical part of MP, or at least the spirit of the new intellectual deed proposed and called <span id="EUSOPHY">eusophy</span> there, because it is crucial both for humankind and for individuals.
Namely, it leads to an answer to the problem
</p>
<blockquote>
What should anyone do?
</blockquote>
<p>
and it aims at
</p>
<blockquote>
the pursuit of a way for humankind to survive
</blockquote>
<p>
in view of the alarm climate scientists are ringing, which especially implies
</p>
<blockquote>
In the not too distant future, the global temperature rise (the so-called global warming) may become a threat to survival of humankind.
</blockquote>
<p>
I have decided to write this article in order to introduce eusophy to worldwide general readership.
</p>
<p>
It is worth noting here that language reflects the mind, but the mind is also shaped by language.
When the words we use are misleading, our thoughts and actions may be misled as well.
For instance, the term ''global warming'' may unconsciously evoke the idea of a pleasantly mild climate, leading some to underestimate the severity of the crisis and to neglect necessary action.
Hence my choice to write ''the global temperature rise (the so-called global warming)'' above.  </p>
<p>
Eusophy subsumes various intellectual deeds, because its aim ''the pursuit of a way for humankind to survive'' is supreme, as suggested by the title of this article.
It also transcends various boundaries, both visible and invisible, such as national borders, because the above-noticed alarm climate scientists are ringing is supplemented as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="ALARTPLUS">
The threat posed by rising global temperatures recognizes no boundaries, not even national ones.
</blockquote>
<p>
Both ''survival'' in the alarm and ''survive'' in the aim of eusophy implies ''continuation as a species.''
Therefore, the following taxonomical knowledge is the starting point of eusophy:
</p>
<blockquote id="ORIGIN">
Humankind is but one among many species.
</blockquote>
<p>
This insight, which I call ''The Declaration of Humankind's Origin,'' should be emphasized together with evolutionism and climate science wherever appropriate, for the following three reasons.
First, even in answering problems about humans, it is helpful to consider their nature as a kind of organisms, i.e. animals, plants and bacteria.
Second, the law of organic evolution rules how species survive.
Third, the mainstay of society does not yet quite seem to react to the above alarm climate scientists are ringing.
</p>
<p>
We conclude this article with a self-explanatory itemized sequence of hypotheses, observations and conclusions, all of which are fully discussed in JC of 236 A4 PDF pages.
</p>
<h2>Hypotheses</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Hypothesis 1.</dt>
<dd>Primitive humans initiated a foundational intellectual activity.</dd>
<dt>Hypothesis 2.</dt>
<dd>Its purpose was to understand causality in order to survive as organisms.</dd>
<dt>Hypothesis 3.</dt>
<dd>Humankind survived as a species thanks to the activity.</dd>
<dt>Hypothesis 4.</dt>
<dd>The activity gradually changed and ramified into some branches.</dd>
<dt>Hypothesis 5.</dt>
<dd>Over time, four of these branches evolved into what we now recognize as science, logic, ethics, and religion.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Observation 1 about today's science which supports Hypothesis 5.</dt>
<dd>Scientists each pursue laws which rule aspects of causality.</dd>
<dt>Observation 2 about today's logic which supports Hypothesis 5.</dt>
<dd>Logic is the knowledge of causality in terms of validity among the declaratives.</dd>
<dt>Observation 3 about today's ethics which supports Hypothesis 5.</dt>
<dd>Ethics is the teachings of deeds which are supposed to be united to moral good by causality.</dd>
<dd>It depends on how moral good is defined.</dd>
<dt>Observation 4 about today's religion which supports Hypothesis 5.</dt>
<dd>Religion is essentially a system of speculations and prayers, both on causality, and the
acceptance of their outcomes.</dd>
<dt>Observation 5 about the global temperature rise.</dt>
<dd>The global temperature rise may become a threat to survival of humankind in the not too distant future, as the alarm climate scientists are ringing especially implies.</dd>
<dt>Observation 6 about organisms.</dt>
<dd>Organisms are the systems for continuing life, which is the process of reproducing its parts, including itself.</dd>
<dt>Observation 7 about humankind.</dt>
<dd>Humankind is but one among many species by ''The Declaration of Humankind's Origin.''</dd>
<dd>Humankind is distinguished from other species by its high intelligence.</dd>
<dd>Civilization, defined as the totality of human knowledges, is a representation of human intelligence.</dd>
<dt>Observation 8 about survival of humankind.</dt>
<dd>Continuation of the biosphere is necessary for survival of humankind, because humankind is a member of the biosphere and all its members are connected via food-carbon cycles, symbiotic relationships and habitat environments.</dd>
<dd>Survival (continuation of life) of enough number of individuals as organisms is necessary for survival (continuation as species) of humankind.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Conclusions through Logical and Eusophic Inquiry</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Conclusion 1 about eusophy.</dt>
<dd>Today's science, logic, ethics and religion should and can unite again into eusophy, i.e. the pursuit of a way for humankind to survive.</dd>
<dt>Conclusion 2 about ethics in eusophy.</dt>
<dd>In eusophy, moral good is defined as that which contributes to survival of humankind.</dd>
<dt>Conclusion 3 about survival of humankind in eusophy.</dt>
<dd>Survival of humankind implies survival of its civilization as defined in Observation 7.</dd>
<dd>Survival of humankind depends on continuation of the biosphere.</dd>
<dd>Survival of humankind implies security, which equally guarantees survival of valuable human groups such as nations (systems of territory, people, polity, economics, civilization, culture, tradition, etc.), races, ethnic groups, families and individuals.</dd>
<dt>Conclusion 4 about what anyone should do and what one can do.</dt>
<dd>What we should do is to contribute to survival of humankind.</dd>
<dd>One can contribute to survival of humankind by contributing to survival, continuation and security as explicated in Conclusions 3 and by participating in establishing, spreading and practicing eusophy.</dd>
<dd>One can also contribute to survival of humankind by nurturing families and communities, including one'’s own.</dd>
